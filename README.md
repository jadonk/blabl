# BLABL

Proximity-based social and augmented reality network



# Origin

BLABL truly is the Tower of Babel reinvisioned for the 21st century, horrific
spelling included. With a consciencely dystopian view of the present, it is an
optimistic social experiment created out of [Sketching in Hardware 2019](http://sketching-in-hardware.com/).
